## The Problem:

### Obesity
 The CDC reported an astounding obesity rate of **42.4%** of all American adults, and **19.3%** of all American children in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. *Even more are overweight.*

This obesity crisis is not limited to one country. The WHO has reported an obesity rate of **13%** of all adults worldwide in 2016. 

### Weight loss

The percentage of individuals who lose weight and successfully maintain the loss has been estimated to be as small as 1%-3%. This means that **97%** of dieters regain everything they lost and then some within three years.
